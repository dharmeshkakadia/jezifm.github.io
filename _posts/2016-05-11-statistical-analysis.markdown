Statistical analysis is a component of __data analytics__. In the context of business intelligence (BI), statistical analysis involves __collecting and scrutinizing every data__ sample in a set of items from which samples can be drawn. A sample, in statistics, is a representative selection drawn from a total population.

Statistical analysis can be broken down into __5 steps__, as follows:

1. Describe the nature of the data to be analyzed.
2. Explore the relation of the data to the underlying population.
3. Create a model to summarize understanding of how the data relates to the underlying population.
4. Prove (or disprove) the validity of the model.
5. Employ predictive analytics to run scenarios that will help guide future actions.
