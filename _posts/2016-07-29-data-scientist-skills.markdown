First thing I see here is that for why it is only **SAS or R** being preferred tool for analytics, python has pandas, scipy and numpy for stats. This should be *Python or R but not both*.

If you are to use python, then go with python. You can integrate it almost anywhere. But when you go with R, you should learn technology stack that supports R.
